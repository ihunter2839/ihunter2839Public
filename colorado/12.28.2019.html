            <h2> December 28-30 </h2>
            <h2> We Made It </h2>       
            <p> 
                Well, we made it in one piece to Granby, Colorado! The weather on I-15 near the junction with I-70 was not the best, but Anuj handled it well (much better than the truckers that were slipping and sliding around). The roads stayed decent until we hit Vail Pass on I-70, but even at its worst point we were comfortably maintaining ~50mph.

                Everything in the room seems to be in good condition - the bedrooms and bathrooms are clean, the furniture is comfortable and not excessively worn, and they replaced the hot tub! Although, I seem to remember there being more basic goods around the kitchen - spices, olive oil, aluminum foil, etc. - in times past that aren't present anymore. Anyways, it's an awfully large room for just 2 people.

            <h2> Dec 29</h2>
            <p>
                We spent the first day around the room, getting in some additional rest and starting our conversations about our new direction for Organize. If I had to sum up the key takeaways from the conversation, it would look something like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin: 5px">
                    The core premise of our application is providing services to individuals who have been negatively impacted by police.
                </li>
                <li style="margin: 5px">
                    The three key groups within our app are 
                    <b>those with police related needs</b>, 
                    <b>groups that can serve those needs</b>,
                    and <b>police</b>
                </li>
                <li style="margin: 5px">
                    We want to foster trust between police and communities by creating better outcomes for individuals with immediate needs instead of playing a data accumulation / network effects game.
                </li>
                <li style="margin: 5px"> 
                    Not <i>everybody</i> is going to have some pertinent action to take within our site and that is <b>ok</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Dec 30</h2>
            <p> 
                Today we headed to Grand Lake for the afternoon and took a short hike to Adam's Falls. I was hoping to see an ice fisherman reel in something exciting but we (and, more tragically, the fishermen) were left empty handed. PSA - doughnuts with traditional glaze and rasberry sauce drizzle are delicious.
