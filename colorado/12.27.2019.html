            <h2> From Los To Las </h2>
            <p> 
                Today was the first leg of our journey from Los Angeles to Granby, CO. We are posted up in Las Vegas for the night and are awaiting Vlad's arrival at our hotel room for a quick team powow. The drive was relatively calm despite the most impressive manuevers of various drivers on the road. I-15 was closed when we were preparing to leave this morning, but over the course of the day snow plows and some good weather cleared the snow and we were able to drive straight into Vegas without taking a detour.

                Eh it's not <i>that</i> far
            </label>  
            <p> 
                Tomorrow's drive will be the more treacherous of the two - we will be getting an early start so we can try to hit most the roads during daylight hours. 
                Until then, don't let the light from Bally's keep ya up.
