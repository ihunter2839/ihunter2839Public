# Mushroom 1 - Spike Stipe

This mushroom has a particularly long and spike like stipe - let's see if we can identify it!

## Key to Major Groups of Fleshly Fungi pg. 52
### Couplet 1 

    Option 1 -
        Spores produced on mother cells called basidia
            AND
        Fruiting body variously shaped
        -> Go to Basidiomycotina, pg. 57
        
    Option 2 -
        Spores produced inside mother cells called asci
            AND
        Fruiting body variously shaped
        -> Go to Ascomycotina, pg. 782

Hrm, that key doesn't seem to help me much! I don't know what a basidia or an asci looks like o.O 

Luckily, we have a visual key on page 52 as well. Looking at the examples of basidiomycetes, it would appear as though our mushroom falls into the first category of **Agarics**

## Basidiomycetes Visual Key pg. 52
### Agarics

    Fruiting body with a cap and stalk, or just a cap
        AND
    Spores borne on gills (radiating blades) on underside of cap
        AND
    Spore print obtainable (if spores are being produced)
    -> Go to Agarics, pg. 58

Our mushroom fits this category pretty well, since we can see that it...

- Has gills
- Has a stalk (or stipe)
- Produces a spore print (more on that later!)

Here's a better picture of the gills just in case you didn't believe me
![Gills and Annulus](media/gills_annulus.JPG)

As a reminder, you should always ready through the _entire_ couplet before assuming that you've made a match! One option might look like it describes your mushroom well, only to find the second option describes it even better! Proceed to the key on page 59.

## Key to Agaricales pg. 59
### Couplet 1
    Option 1 -
        Gills deformed or contored or branched to form large cavities, sometimes never exposed
            AND
        Spores not forcibly discharged, hence spore print not obtainable
            AND
        Found mostly in deserts and mountains
        -> Go to Podaxales & Allies, pg. 724

    Option 2 -
        Not as above
            AND
        Spores forcibly discharged, hence a spore print obtainable if spores are being produced
            AND
        Gills exposed at maturity
            AND
        Common and widespread
        -> Go to Couplet 2

Option 2 is the obvious choice here. The gills are in no way deformed, and a spore print is definitely obtainable. I also found this mushroom in the Mt. Madona area, so it is not in high mountains or desert. 

### Couplet 2 
    Option 1 -
        Spore print white to buff, yellow-orange, or lilac-tinged
        -> Go to Couplet 3

    Option 2 - 
        Spore print some other color, such as pinkish, salmon, yellow-brown, brown, rusty orange, rusty brown, chocolate brown, purplish, greenish, black, etc.
        -> Go to Couplet 10

Well, now seems like a pretty good time to take a spore print.

1. Cut the cap of the mushroom from the stalk. You want to cut as close to the cap as possible so that the cap can sit low on our spore collecting surface.
![Cutting the Cap](media/cut_cap.JPG)

2. Place your cap gills down on a clean surface. I like to use aluminum foil, as it makes it easy to see white spores and can be cleaned and used multiple times. Paper is another good candidate. 
![Cap Face Down](media/place_cap.JPG)

3. Cover your cap! This part isn't totally necessary, but spores are awfully small and can be carried by miniscule air currents. Covering the cap helps ensure more spores fall down and onto our surface instead of out and into the air. 
![Cover the Cap](media/cover_cap.JPG)

4. Give it a minute... or really, more like 2-6 hours.
Remove the cover, flip the cap over and wala!
![Spore Print](media/spore_print.JPG)

Here was can see that our mushroom has white spores. That means that it matches the first option of the second couplet, and we can proceed to couplet 3.

### Couplet 3
    Option 1 -
        Universal veil enveloping young specimens and forming a volva at base of stalk when it ruptures
            AND / OR
        Universal veil leaving numerous remnants (warts or flat patches) on cap
        -> Go to Amanitacae, pg. 262

    Option 2 - 
        Neither volva nor wards present (but cap and stalk may have scales or fibrils)
        -> Go to Couplet 4

Well, to be honest... I don't think I dug down far enough to see if there was a volva! These stipes were so long that I would have needed a much bigger knife to get to the base of them. 

![Veil Types](media/veil_types.png)

I am going to make a guess, based on the long tapered end of the mushroom, that there wasn't a volva hidden down there - and our mushroom does not have any sort of warts on the cap. We can proceed to couplet 4.

### Couplet 4
    Option 1 -
        Gills typically free and veil present
            AND
        Veil usually forming and annulus (ring) on stalk, or if not then stalk typically scaly or slimy below the veil
        -> Go to Couplet 5

    Option 2 -
        Not as above
            AND
        Veil absent, or if present then gills normally attached to stalk
        -> Go to Couplet 6

This one is a little tricky. Our mushroom certainly has a partial veil.
![Partial Veil](media/partial_veil.JPG)

And it has an annulus.
![Annulus](media/annulus.JPG)

But the gills are definitely attached to the stalk.
![Attached Gills](media/gills_slice.JPG)

If the gills were free, the first option would be a slam dunk. However, this mushroom's gills are firmly attached, and so it seems the second option is a better fit. Proceed to couplet 6.

### Couplet 6
    Option 1 -
        Gills decurrent and foldlike, i.e., gills thick, blunt, shallow, and usually forked with cross veins
        -> Go to Cantharellacae, pg. 658

    Option 2 -
        Not as above;
            AND
        Gills usually platelike or bladelike
        -> Go to Couplet 7

![Gills Close Up](media/gills_close.jpg)

Our mushrooms falls cleanly into the second option, with bladelike gills that do not exhibit significant forking. Proceed to couplet 7.

### Couplet 7
    Option 1 -
        Gills and / or flesh exuding a latex (milk or juice) when broken
            AND
        Stalk typically more than 3 mm thick
        -> Go to Russulacae, pg. 63

    Option 2 - 
        Not as above
        -> Go to Couplet 8

This couplet is checking for mushrooms in the genus Lactarius, which extrude a milky colored fluid when cut. 
In the image below, our mushroom is on the left, severely abused but still not extruding any sort of latex. On the right is an example Lactarius producing its characteristic milky colored fluid.
![Example Lactarius](media/not_lactarius.JPG)

We can proceed to couplet 8.

### Couplet 8
    Option 1 -
        Fruiting body brittle and rather rigid, the stalk snapping open cleanly like a piece of chalk (without fibrous context)
            AND
        Cap usually plane to depressed at maturity
            AND
        Stalk typically 3mm thick
            AND
        Veil absent
            AND
        Usually but not always terrestrial
            AND
        ...
        -> Go to Russulacae, pg. 63

    Option 2 - 
        Not with above features
        -> Go to Couplet 9

Well, we can already say with confidence that the cap was not depressed at maturity and that our mushroom *does* have a veil. Additionally, I tried snapping the stalk - 

![Snapping Stalk](media/stalk_snapping.JPG)

Certainly not like any piece of chalk I've ever felt. You can see the "fibrous context" that prevents the stalk from breaking apart cleanly. We can proceed to couplet 9.

### Couplet 9
    Option 1 -
        Gills soft and clean, with a waxy appearance or texture
            AND
        Cap often brightly colored
            AND
        Stalk more or less central
            AND
        Usually terrestial
            AND
        ...
        -> Go to Hygrophoracae, pg. 103

    Option 2 -
        Not as above
            AND
        Gills not normally waxy
            AND
        Stalk central to lateral or absent
            AND
        On ground or wood
        -> Go to Tricholomataceae, pg. 129

This couplet is also a little bit tricky - would you cconsider the gills of the mushroom to be "waxy"? I got myself a piece of waxed paper so that I could compare the feeling of a waxed object and the gills, and my conclusion is that the gills **do not** have a waxy texture. Additionally, these mushrooms were growing from the base of a dying tree, so option 2 seems to be a better fit. Proceed to page 129.

## Key to Tricholomataceae pg. 129

### Couplet 1
    Option 1 -
        Growing on other mushrooms
            AND
        Gills thick and widely spaced or poorly formed to practically absent
        -> Go to Asterophora pg. 200

    Option 2 - 
        Not growing on other mushrooms, or if so then gills well developed, thin, close
        -> Go to Couplet 2

Our mushrooms was clearly not growing from another mushroom, so we can choose option 2 and proceed to couplet 2.

### Couplet 2
    Option 1 -
        Fruiting body pinkish to salmon, orange, or yellow-orange
            AND
        Cap surface conspicuously reticulate (netted or veined and pitted)
            AND
        Cap 2-5cm broad
            AND
        Stalk central or off center, tough
            AND
        Spore print pinkish
            AND
        Found on dead eastern hardwoods (e.g. maple), infrequent
        -> Go to Rhodotus palmatus 

    Option 2 -
        Not as above
        -> Go to Couplet 3

Our mushrooms doesn't meet the requirements for option 1, since

- The spores are white
- The cap is primarily tan and brown
- The cap isn't netted, veined, or pitted

Option 2 seems like the best choice, so we can proceed to couplet 3.

### Couplet 3
    Option 1 -
        Stalk absent, or if present then typically off-center to lateral
            AND
        Usually growing on wood (or woody material) or on moss
        -> Go to Couplet 4

    Option 2 -
        Stalk present, well developed, more or less central
            AND
        Growing on ground or wood
        -> Go to Couplet 6

Our mushroom has a very well developed, central stalk - it was the first thing I noticed about these mushrooms!
Option 2 seems to be the best fit, so we can proceed to couplet 6.

### Couplet 6
    Option 1 -
        Stalk arising from an underground "tuber" (the "tuber being cylindrical or bulbous, often hollow)
            AND
        Cap usually scaly, fibrillose, or granulose
            AND
        Not common
        -> Go to Squamanita, pg. 197

    Option 2 -
        Not as above (but stalk may have a tapered underground "tap root")
        -> Go to Couplet 7

![Mushroom Cap](media/cap.JPG)

Once again, I don't think I dug down deep enough to see if there was a "tuber" somewhere in the soil. But, I don't feel like the cap of our mushroom is particularly scaly, fibrillose (like strands of cotton candy), or granulose (like crystals of suger). Additionally, the long, tapered "tap root" matches our mushroom well, making option 2 seem like a better match. Proceed to couplet 7.

### Couplet 7
    Option 1 -
        Cap granulose (covred with a layer of mealy or powdery granules that are sometimes washed off by rain)
            AND
        Veil present (check young specimens!), sometimes forming an annulus on stalk
            AND
        Stalk granulose below veil
        -> Go to Cystoderma pg. 198

    Option 2 - 
        Not as above
            AND
        Veil absent, or if veil present then cap and stalk not granulose
        -> Go to Couplet 8

Sometimes, it helpful to see an example of a specific characteristic (like a granulose cap) to get a better sense of whether or not our mushroom meets the given criteria. Here's an example of *Cystoderma fallax*
![Cystodermas have a granular cap](media/cystoderma.jpg)

Our mushroom definitely does not have the sort of granular covering on its cap or below its veil as described in option 1, so option 2 seems like a better fit. Proceed to couplet 8.

### Couplet 8
    Option 1 -
        Veil present, usually forming a distinct annulus on stalk
        -> Go to Armillaria & Allies, pg. 189

    Option 2 -
        Veil absent or rudimentary and evanescent, not forming an annulus
        -> Go to Couplet 9

Our mushroom falls squarely in option 1, so we finally have found a (potential) genus! Proceed to the key for Armillaria and allies on page 189. 

## Key to Armillaria & Allies

### Couplet 1
    Option 1 -
        Growing on wood (may be burried!) or at the base of trees, sometimes in large clusters
        -> Go to Couplet 2

    Option 2 -
        Growing widely scattered to gregarious on ground (not normally in large cluster)
        -> Go to Couplet 5

Our mushroom was growing from the base of a dying tree, so option 1 seems to be the best fit. Proceed to couplet 2.

### Couplet 2
    Option 1 -
        Cap with rusty brown scales
            AND
        Stalk sheathed with similarly colored fibrils below the veil
            AND
        Gills typically *not* decurrent
            AND
        Found on hardwoods in eastern North America
            AND
        Rare
        -> Go to Armillaria decorosa
    
    Option 2 -
        Not as above
            AND
        Common
        -> Go to Couplet 3

Option 1 doesn't sound great, but our mushroom does have some tenrils on the cap and stalk that are brownish. Once again, a picture of the species that would key us to can help lead us in the right direction.

![Armillaria decorosa](media/armillaria_decorosa.jpg)

This is obviously not what we have, so we can proceed with couplet 3. 

### Couplet 3
    Option 1 -
        Cap some shade of yellow, tan, or brown
            AND
        Tase usually bitter (but not detectable by everyone)
            AND
        Stalk fibrous, with a stringy white puth inside, often long
        -> Go to Couplet 18

    Option 2 - 
        Not as above
            AND
        Cap paler in color or the stalk solid or hard
        -> Go to Couplet 4

Our mushroom has a brown cap and an extremely long and fibrous stalk, so option 1 seems like a good fit. I tasted the cap, but it didn't seem bitter to me! Proceed to couplet 18.

### Couplet 18
    Option 1 - 
        Veil absent
        -> Go to Armillariella tabescens (A. mellea, pg. 196)

    Option 2 -
        Veil present, at least when young
        -> Go to Couplet 19

Our mushroom has veil, so option 2 is our best choice. Proceed to couplet 19.

### Couplet 19
    Option 1 -
        Stalk usually bulbous or thick at base
            AND
        Veil cottony, not typically forming a prominent ring
            AND
        Often on ground, not in large clusters
        -> Go to Armillariella bulbosa (A. mellea, pg. 196)

    Option 2 -
        Not as above
            AND
        Often with a prominent ring, often clustered
        -> Go to Armillariella mellea group, pg. 196

Our mushroom does not have a bulbous stipe; instead, it is long and tapered. It also has prominent annulus and was found in a cluster of 5 mushrooms. Option 2 seems like a better match - although both options lead to the same result! Proceed to Armillariella mellea group, page 196.

## Armillariella mellea group - Honey Mushroom pg. 196

As the comments in *Mushrooms Demystified* point out, the Honey mushroom is an extremely variable group. While it is edible, I don't feel confident enough in my identification of the mushroom to try eating it, so this one gets tossed to the mushroom pile. When in doubt, throw it out!
