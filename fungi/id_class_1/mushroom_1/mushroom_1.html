<p>Hrm, that key doesn’t seem to help me much! I don’t know what a basidia or an asci looks like o.O</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a visual key on page 52 as well. Looking at the examples of basidiomycetes, it would appear as though our mushroom falls into the first category of <strong>Agarics</strong></p>

-&gt; Go to Agarics, pg. 58</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom fits this category pretty well, since we can see that it…</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gills</li>
<li>Has a stalk (or stipe)</li>
<li>Produces a spore print (more on that later!)</li>

<p>Here’s a better picture of the gills just in case you didn’t believe me <img src="media/gills_annulus.JPG" alt="Gills and Annulus" /></p>
<p>As a reminder, you should always ready through the <em>entire</em> couplet before assuming that you’ve made a match! One option might look like it describes your mushroom well, only to find the second option describes it even better! Proceed to the key on page 59.</p>
<h2 id="key-to-agaricales-pg.-59">Key to Agaricales pg. 59</h2>
<h3 id="couplet-1-1">Couplet 1</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Gills deformed or contored or branched to form large cavities, sometimes never exposed
        AND
    Spores not forcibly discharged, hence spore print not obtainable
        AND
    Found mostly in deserts and mountains
    -&gt; Go to Podaxales &amp; Allies, pg. 724

Option 2 -
    Not as above
        AND
    Spores forcibly discharged, hence a spore print obtainable if spores are being produced
        AND
    Gills exposed at maturity
        AND
    Common and widespread
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 2</code></pre>
<p>Option 2 is the obvious choice here. The gills are in no way deformed, and a spore print is definitely obtainable. I also found this mushroom in the Mt. Madona area, so it is not in high mountains or desert.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-2">Couplet 2</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Spore print white to buff, yellow-orange, or lilac-tinged
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 3

Option 2 - 
    Spore print some other color, such as pinkish, salmon, yellow-brown, brown, rusty orange, rusty brown, chocolate brown, purplish, greenish, black, etc.
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 10</code></pre>
<p>Well, now seems like a pretty good time to take a spore print.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Cut the cap of the mushroom from the stalk. You want to cut as close to the cap as possible so that the cap can sit low on our spore collecting surface. <img src="media/cut_cap.JPG" alt="Cutting the Cap" /></p></li>
<li><p>Place your cap gills down on a clean surface. I like to use aluminum foil, as it makes it easy to see white spores and can be cleaned and used multiple times. Paper is another good candidate. <img src="media/place_cap.JPG" alt="Cap Face Down" /></p></li>
<li><p>Cover your cap! This part isn’t totally necessary, but spores are awfully small and can be carried by miniscule air currents. Covering the cap helps ensure more spores fall down and onto our surface instead of out and into the air. <img src="media/cover_cap.JPG" alt="Cover the Cap" /></p></li>
<li><p>Give it a minute… or really, more like 2-6 hours. Remove the cover, flip the cap over and wala! <img src="media/spore_print.JPG" alt="Spore Print" /></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here was can see that our mushroom has white spores. That means that it matches the first option of the second couplet, and we can proceed to couplet 3.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-3">Couplet 3</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Universal veil enveloping young specimens and forming a volva at base of stalk when it ruptures
        AND / OR
    Universal veil leaving numerous remnants (warts or flat patches) on cap
    -&gt; Go to Amanitacae, pg. 262

Option 2 - 
    Neither volva nor wards present (but cap and stalk may have scales or fibrils)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 4</code></pre>
<p>Well, to be honest… I don’t think I dug down far enough to see if there was a volva! These stipes were so long that I would have needed a much bigger knife to get to the base of them.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/veil_types.png" alt="Veil Types" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Veil Types</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I am going to make a guess, based on the long tapered end of the mushroom, that there wasn’t a volva hidden down there - and our mushroom does not have any sort of warts on the cap. We can proceed to couplet 4.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-4">Couplet 4</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Gills typically free and veil present
        AND
    Veil usually forming and annulus (ring) on stalk, or if not then stalk typically scaly or slimy below the veil
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 5

Option 2 -
    Not as above
        AND
    Veil absent, or if present then gills normally attached to stalk
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 6</code></pre>
<p>This one is a little tricky. Our mushroom certainly has a partial veil. <img src="media/partial_veil.JPG" alt="Partial Veil" /></p>
<p>And it has an annulus. <img src="media/annulus.JPG" alt="Annulus" /></p>
<p>But the gills are definitely attached to the stalk. <img src="media/gills_slice.JPG" alt="Attached Gills" /></p>
<p>If the gills were free, the first option would be a slam dunk. However, this mushroom’s gills are firmly attached, and so it seems the second option is a better fit. Proceed to couplet 6.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-6">Couplet 6</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Gills decurrent and foldlike, i.e., gills thick, blunt, shallow, and usually forked with cross veins
    -&gt; Go to Cantharellacae, pg. 658

Option 2 -
    Not as above;
        AND
    Gills usually platelike or bladelike
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 7</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="media/gills_close.jpg" alt="Gills Close Up" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Gills Close Up</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our mushrooms falls cleanly into the second option, with bladelike gills that do not exhibit significant forking. Proceed to couplet 7.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-7">Couplet 7</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Gills and / or flesh exuding a latex (milk or juice) when broken
        AND
    Stalk typically more than 3 mm thick
    -&gt; Go to Russulacae, pg. 63

Option 2 - 
    Not as above
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 8</code></pre>
<p>This couplet is checking for mushrooms in the genus Lactarius, which extrude a milky colored fluid when cut. In the image below, our mushroom is on the left, severely abused but still not extruding any sort of latex. On the right is an example Lactarius producing its characteristic milky colored fluid. <img src="media/not_lactarius.JPG" alt="Example Lactarius" /></p>
<p>We can proceed to couplet 8.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-8">Couplet 8</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Fruiting body brittle and rather rigid, the stalk snapping open cleanly like a piece of chalk (without fibrous context)
        AND
    Cap usually plane to depressed at maturity
        AND
    Stalk typically 3mm thick
        AND
    Veil absent
        AND
    Usually but not always terrestrial
        AND
    ...
    -&gt; Go to Russulacae, pg. 63

Option 2 - 
    Not with above features
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 9</code></pre>
<p>Well, we can already say with confidence that the cap was not depressed at maturity and that our mushroom <em>does</em> have a veil. Additionally, I tried snapping the stalk -</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/stalk_snapping.JPG" alt="Snapping Stalk" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Snapping Stalk</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certainly not like any piece of chalk I’ve ever felt. You can see the “fibrous context” that prevents the stalk from breaking apart cleanly. We can proceed to couplet 9.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-9">Couplet 9</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Gills soft and clean, with a waxy appearance or texture
        AND
    Cap often brightly colored
        AND
    Stalk more or less central
        AND
    Usually terrestial
        AND
    ...
    -&gt; Go to Hygrophoracae, pg. 103

Option 2 -
    Not as above
        AND
    Gills not normally waxy
        AND
    Stalk central to lateral or absent
        AND
    On ground or wood
    -&gt; Go to Tricholomataceae, pg. 129</code></pre>
<p>This couplet is also a little bit tricky - would you cconsider the gills of the mushroom to be “waxy”? I got myself a piece of waxed paper so that I could compare the feeling of a waxed object and the gills, and my conclusion is that the gills <strong>do not</strong> have a waxy texture. Additionally, these mushrooms were growing from the base of a dying tree, so option 2 seems to be a better fit. Proceed to page 129.</p>
<h2 id="key-to-tricholomataceae-pg.-129">Key to Tricholomataceae pg. 129</h2>
<h3 id="couplet-1-2">Couplet 1</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Growing on other mushrooms
        AND
    Gills thick and widely spaced or poorly formed to practically absent
    -&gt; Go to Asterophora pg. 200

Option 2 - 
    Not growing on other mushrooms, or if so then gills well developed, thin, close
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 2</code></pre>
<p>Our mushrooms was clearly not growing from another mushroom, so we can choose option 2 and proceed to couplet 2.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-2-1">Couplet 2</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Fruiting body pinkish to salmon, orange, or yellow-orange
        AND
    Cap surface conspicuously reticulate (netted or veined and pitted)
        AND
    Cap 2-5cm broad
        AND
    Stalk central or off center, tough
        AND
    Spore print pinkish
        AND
    Found on dead eastern hardwoods (e.g. maple), infrequent
    -&gt; Go to Rhodotus palmatus 

Option 2 -
    Not as above
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 3</code></pre>
<p>Our mushrooms doesn’t meet the requirements for option 1, since</p>
<ul>
<li>The spores are white</li>
<li>The cap is primarily tan and brown</li>
<li>The cap isn’t netted, veined, or pitted</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 2 seems like the best choice, so we can proceed to couplet 3.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-3-1">Couplet 3</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Stalk absent, or if present then typically off-center to lateral
        AND
    Usually growing on wood (or woody material) or on moss
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 4

Option 2 -
    Stalk present, well developed, more or less central
        AND
    Growing on ground or wood
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 6</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom has a very well developed, central stalk - it was the first thing I noticed about these mushrooms! Option 2 seems to be the best fit, so we can proceed to couplet 6.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-6-1">Couplet 6</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Stalk arising from an underground &quot;tuber&quot; (the &quot;tuber being cylindrical or bulbous, often hollow)
        AND
    Cap usually scaly, fibrillose, or granulose
        AND
    Not common
    -&gt; Go to Squamanita, pg. 197

Option 2 -
    Not as above (but stalk may have a tapered underground &quot;tap root&quot;)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 7</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="media/cap.JPG" alt="Mushroom Cap" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Mushroom Cap</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once again, I don’t think I dug down deep enough to see if there was a “tuber” somewhere in the soil. But, I don’t feel like the cap of our mushroom is particularly scaly, fibrillose (like strands of cotton candy), or granulose (like crystals of suger). Additionally, the long, tapered “tap root” matches our mushroom well, making option 2 seem like a better match. Proceed to couplet 7.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-7-1">Couplet 7</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Cap granulose (covred with a layer of mealy or powdery granules that are sometimes washed off by rain)
        AND
    Veil present (check young specimens!), sometimes forming an annulus on stalk
        AND
    Stalk granulose below veil
    -&gt; Go to Cystoderma pg. 198

Option 2 - 
    Not as above
        AND
    Veil absent, or if veil present then cap and stalk not granulose
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 8</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, it helpful to see an example of a specific characteristic (like a granulose cap) to get a better sense of whether or not our mushroom meets the given criteria. Here’s an example of <em>Cystoderma fallax</em> <img src="media/cystoderma.jpg" alt="Cystodermas have a granular cap" /></p>
<p>Our mushroom definitely does not have the sort of granular covering on its cap or below its veil as described in option 1, so option 2 seems like a better fit. Proceed to couplet 8.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-8-1">Couplet 8</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Veil present, usually forming a distinct annulus on stalk
    -&gt; Go to Armillaria &amp; Allies, pg. 189

Option 2 -
    Veil absent or rudimentary and evanescent, not forming an annulus
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 9</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom falls squarely in option 1, so we finally have found a (potential) genus! Proceed to the key for Armillaria and allies on page 189.</p>

Option 2 -
    Growing widely scattered to gregarious on ground (not normally in large cluster)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 5</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom was growing from the base of a dying tree, so option 1 seems to be the best fit. Proceed to couplet 2.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-2-2">Couplet 2</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Cap with rusty brown scales
        AND
    Stalk sheathed with similarly colored fibrils below the veil

    Gills typically *not* decurrent

    Found on hardwoods in eastern North America
        AND
    Rare

Option 2 -
    Not as above
        AND
    Common
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 3</code></pre>
<p>Option 1 doesn’t sound great, but our mushroom does have some tenrils on the cap and stalk that are brownish. Once again, a picture of the species that would key us to can help lead us in the right direction.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/armillaria_decorosa.jpg" alt="Armillaria decorosa" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Armillaria decorosa</figcaption>

<p>This is obviously not what we have, so we can proceed with couplet 3.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-3-2">Couplet 3</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Cap some shade of yellow, tan, or brown
        AND

<p>Our mushroom does not have a bulbous stipe; instead, it is long and tapered. It also has prominent annulus and was found in a cluster of 5 mushrooms. Option 2 seems like a better match - although both options lead to the same result! Proceed to Armillariella mellea group, page 196.</p>

<p>As the comments in <em>Mushrooms Demystified</em> point out, the Honey mushroom is an extremely variable group. While it is edible, I don’t feel confident enough in my identification of the mushroom to try eating it, so this one gets tossed to the mushroom pile. When in doubt, throw it out!</p>
