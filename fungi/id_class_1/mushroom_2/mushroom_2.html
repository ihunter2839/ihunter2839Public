<p>In the guide for Mushroom 1, we glanced over this couplet and moved directly into the visual key. Let’s do the same thing here, and move to the visual key for the <strong>Boletes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="basidiomycetes-visual-key-pg.-52">Basidiomycetes Visual Key pg. 52</h2>
<h3 id="boletes">Boletes</h3>
<pre><code>Fruiting body with cap and stalk, fleshy (not tough or woody)
    AND
Underside of cap with spongy, often separable layer of tube or pores
    AND
Stalk more or less central
    AND
Usually on ground but occasionally on wood
-&gt; Go to Boletes, pg. 488</code></pre>
<p>The first thing that should be apparent with this mushroom is that it doesn’t have gills; instead, the underside of the cap is covered with layer of vertically arranged tubes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/tubes.JPG" alt="Bolete tubes" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bolete tubes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A quick note on the usage of the word <strong>bolete</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boletaceae</strong> is the name of the <em>familiy</em> of mushrooms that have tubes on the underside of their caps.</li>
<li>The Boletaceae family contains a number of <em>genera</em>, one of which is named <strong><em>Boletus</em></strong></li>
<li>The common term <em>“bolete”</em> is applicable to <strong>all the mushrooms in the family Boletaceae</strong>, not just those in the genus <em>Boletus</em></li>
<li>Example: <em>Suillus luteus</em>, or the Slippery Jack, is not part of the genus <em>Boletus</em>, but is still commonly called a “bolete”</li>
</ul>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s proceed to the key for Boletes.</p>
<h2 id="key-to-the-boletaceae-pg.-489">Key to the Boletaceae pg. 489</h2>
<h3 id="couplet-1-1">Couplet 1</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Fruiting body often appearing aborted or misshapen and often buried or partially buried in the humus
        AND
    Tubes at least somewhat disoriented (i.e. not necessarilly arranged vertically)
        AND
    Spore print unobtainable
        AND
    Not common
    -&gt; Go to Gastroboletus pg. 544

Option 2 - 
    Not as above
        AND
    Tubes vertically arranged
        AND
    Spore print usually obtainable
        AND
    Usually found above the ground when mature
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 2</code></pre>
<p>The fruiting body on our mushroom is very well formed, with a substaintial and fleshy cap. Additionally, the tubes are oriented in a consistenly vertical arrangement, so option 2 seems like the best fit. Proceed to couplet 2.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-2">Couplet 2</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Cap and stalk shaggy or coarsely scaly, the scales gray to brown or black
        AND
    Pores whitish becoming gray or black in age
        AND
    Veil present when young
        AND
    Spore print dark brown to black
        AND
    Spores shiny, warty, or reticulate
        AND
    Found in eastern North America and Southwest
    -&gt; Go to Strobilomyces, pg. 543

Option 2 - 
    Not as above
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 3</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom doesn’t have a shaggy stalk or cap, and the pores (or tubes) are yellow to red in color. Option 2 seems like the better fit, proceed to couplet 3.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-3">Couplet 3</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Stalk roughened by smalled tufted hairs or scales (scabers) which are usually gray to dark brown or black by maturity (but differently colored or remaining pallid in a few species)
        AND
    Stalk not glandular-dotted and typically not reticulare
        AND
    Pores rarely yellow
    -&gt; Go to Leccinum, pg. 536

Option 2 - 
    Not as above
        AND
    Stalk typically without scabers 
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 4</code></pre>
<p>I am not familiar with what scabers look like, so let’s get a comparison of our mushroom with a typical member of <em>Leccinum</em> genus. On the left is our mystery mushroom, and on the right is <em>Leccinum aurantiacum</em>, with its distinctive black scabers.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/scabers.JPG" alt="An example of scabers" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">An example of scabers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our mushroom doesn’t seem to have scabers, and our pores are <em>very</em> yellow, so option 2 seems to be the best choice. Proceed to couplet 4.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-4">Couplet 4</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Bright, yellow, dry, cottony-powdery or cobwebby veil present when young, usually leaving cottony remnants on cap and / or stalk 
        AND
    Pores and flesh usually blueing (sometimes slowly) when bruised
    -&gt; Go to Pulveroboletus

Option 2 -
    Veil absent, or if present then not as above 
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 5</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom does not seem to have any remnants of a bright yellow, cottony veil - <em>Pulveroboletus ravenelii</em> looks something like the image below before the veil breaks.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/pulveroboletus.jpg" alt="Example of Pulveroboletus" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example of Pulveroboletus</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lets choose option 2 and proceed to couplet 5.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-5">Couplet 5</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Veil present when young, sometimes forming a ring (annulus) on stalk, at other times clinging to the margin of cap, and in still other cases disappearing in age
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 9

Option 2 -
    Veil absent (check young speciments if unsure), but cap sometimes fringed with sterile tissue
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 6</code></pre>
<p>This couplet is tricky, since I didn’t collect any young specimens that would still have an intact veil. I’ll try to make an educated guess, and if the key leads to a dead end, this will be a good place to circle back to.</p>
<p>I don’t see any remnants of a veil on the cap or on the stipe of the mushroom. Looking closely at the margin of the cap, you can see a thin ring of tissue - this sounds similar to what is described by “fringed with sterile tissue”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/sterile_tissue.JPG" alt="An example of the sterile tissue ring?" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">An example of the sterile tissue ring?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s proceed with couplet 6.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-6">Couplet 6</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Stalk with grandular dots or smears at least when mature (the dots often slightly resinous to the touch)
        AND
    Stalk usually more or less equal or at least not markedly bulbous
        AND
    Cap often (but not always) viscid
        AND
    Spore print olive to brown or dull cinnamon
    -&gt; Go to Suillus, pg. 491

Option 2 - 
    Stalk not grandular dotted (or very rarely so, but then with much darker spores)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 7</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom does have some markings on it stipe, but they seem more linear or reticulare and don’t feel resinous at all. Compare our mushroom on the left with <em>Suillus pungens</em> with its characteristic granular dotted stipe on the right.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/stalk.JPG" alt="Stipe markings" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Stipe markings</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I think option 2 is a better fit here - let’s proceed to couplet 7.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-7">Couplet 7</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Pores often radially elongated, sinous, arranged in rows, and / or veined
        AND
    Taste of cap not peppery
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 8

Option 2 -
    Pores not as above, or if so then peppery
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 10</code></pre>
<p>Once again, it helps to see a species with elongated pores so we can compare it to our mushroom. On the left is our mushroom, and on the right is <em>Suillus cavipes</em> with its radially elongated and radially arranged pores.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/pores.JPG" alt="Suillus cavipes" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Suillus cavipes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I think option 2 is a better fit, so we can proceed to couplet 10.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-10">Couplet 10</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Cap viscid to very slimy when moist
        AND
    Stalk grandular-dotted or if not then stalk typically white to yellow and not reticulate
        AND
    Associated with conifers
    -&gt; Go to Suillus, pg. 491

Option 2 - 
    Not with above features
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 11</code></pre>
<p>The cap of our mushroom is certainly not viscid - even when wetted, the cap remains relatively coarse and does not become slippery. Additionally, our stipe does not have grandular dots, is not white, and shows some reticulate (netted or meshed) markings. Let’s proceed to couplet 11.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-11">Couplet 11</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Spore print flesh-colored to pinkish-brown, reddish-brown, vinaceous, or chocolate-brown
        AND
    Pores typically white to pinkish, vinaceous, gray, or brown but not red and only rarely yellow
        AND
    Common in eastern North America but rather infrequent in the West
    -&gt; Go to Tylopilus, pg. 532

Option 2 - 
    Not as above
        AND
    Spore print yellow to yellow-brown, olive-brown, olive, brown, or more rarely cinnamon-brown; pores white, yellow, olive, red, orange, or sometimes gray or brown
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 12</code></pre>
<p>Well, let’s see what our spore print looks like. If you need help with spore prints, you can find a more thorough description in the key for <a href="/fungi/id_class_1/mushroom_1/mushroom_1.html">Mushroom 1</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/spores.JPG" alt="Spore print" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Spore print</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Given the yellow to olive spores and our yellow to red pores, option 2 is the natural choice. Proceed to couplet 12.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-12">Couplet 12</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Spore print pale yellow to yellow
        AND
    Stalk often hollow or partially hollow at maturity (especially near base)
        AND
    Common in eastern North America, rare in the West
    -&gt; Go to Gyroporus pg. 510

Option 2 - 
    Spore print olive-brown to olive or brown, or occasionally yellow-brown or cinnamon-brown
        AND
    Stalk not normally hollow
        AND
    Common and widespread
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 13</code></pre>
<p>It is hard for me to say whether or spore print is yellow or olive… but what I can say for certain is the the stipe was <em>not</em> hollow at any point.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/cross_stipe.JPG" alt="Cross section of stipe" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cross section of stipe</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s proceed with couplet 13.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-13">Couplet 13</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Spores ornamented with ridges, grooves, pits, etc
        AND
    Stalk usually relatively long (7cm or more) and slender and coarsely reticulate or conspicuously lined with jagged ridges for most of its length
        AND
    Pores yellow to greenish-yellow, not usually blueing when bruised
        AND
    Typically terrestrial
        AND
    Found in eastern North America and the Southwest
    -&gt; Go to Boletellus and Austroboletus, pg. 508

Option 2 - 
    Not with above combination of features
        AND
    Spores typically smooth
        AND
    Widespread
    -&gt; Go to Boletus, pg. 511</code></pre>
<p>I don’t have a microscope, so we will have to pass over the microscopic characteristics for now. However, our mushroom certainly blues when bruised - I used the end of a pen to bruise this cross section and let it sit for about 30 seconds.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/blueing.JPG" alt="Blueing after bruising" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Blueing after bruising</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s proceed to the key for <em>Boletus</em>.</p>
<h2 id="key-to-boletus-pg.-512">Key to Boletus pg. 512</h2>
<h3 id="couplet-1-2">Couplet 1</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Growing on earthballs (Scleroderma species)
        AND
    Fruiting body small to medium-sized, usually rather soft
        AND
    Especially common in southern latitudes
    -&gt; Boletus parasiticus

Option 2 -
    Growing on ground or wood, not on earthballs
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 2</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom was quite clearly growing from the ground and not from an earthball - here’s a picture of one in case, like me, you’ve never seen one!</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/earthball.jpg" alt="Earthball" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Earthball</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s proceed to couplet 2.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-2-1">Couplet 2</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Taste distinctly acrid (peppery) when a small piece of cap is chewed
        AND
    Fruiting body typically rather small, with bright yellow mycelium at base 
    -&gt; Go to Boletus piperatus &amp; others, pg. 517

Option 2 - 
    Not as above (but taste may be bitter or sour)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 3</code></pre>
<p>The taste of the cap of our mushroom was extremely mild, without any sort of peppery or bitter tones. Additionally, there wasn’t any sort of yellow mycelium growing from the tapered tip of the stipe. Let’s proceed to couplet 3.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-3-1">Couplet 3</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Growing on or near wood or in sawdust (especially coniferous)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 4

Option 2 -
    Growing on ground 
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 7</code></pre>
<p>Our mushroom was growing from the ground the duff of oak and manzanita leaves, so option 2 seems to be a better fit. Let’s proceed to couplet 7.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-7-1">Couplet 7</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Found in western North America (Rocky Mountains, Southwest, and westward)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 8

Option 2 -
    Found in eastern North America (east of the Rockies, also southern Arizona)
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 42</code></pre>
<p>Given that this is a remote mushroom class, I suppose I <em>could</em> have been out mushrooming east of the Rockies, but given the pandemic circumstances, I promise you I didn’t. We can proceed to couplet 8.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-8">Couplet 8</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Pore surface red, pink, vinaceous, or orange when fresh (but may be yellowish or dingier in age, or in one case yellow when young becoming red in age)
        AND
    Pore surface and flesh usually turning blue or blue-black when bruised or cut
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 9

Option 2 - 
    Pore surface yellow to olive, brown, white, etc, but not red or orange
        AND
    Pore surface may or may not turn blue when bruised</code></pre>
<p>The pores of our mushroom definitely have an red to orange tint, so option 1 is the clear choice. Proceed to couplet 9.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-9">Couplet 9</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Stalk distinctly reticulate (netted), at least over upper portion
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 10

Option 2 -
    Stalk not reticulate, or only very slightly so from decurrent tube walls
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 13</code></pre>
<p>To get an idea of what a reticulate stalk would look like, let’s look at prime candidate - <em>Boletus satanis</em>, or Satan’s bolete (an apt name!). The mesh like pattern at the base of the stipe is highlighted.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/boletus_satanis.jpg" alt="Boletus Satanis" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Boletus Satanis</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While our mushroom seems to have some degree of reticulation on the stipe, I wouldn’t say it is <em>distinctive</em>. Let’s choose option 2 and proceed to couplet 13.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-13-1">Couplet 13</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 -
    Cap intensely yellow, quite large
        AND
    Rare
    -&gt; Go to Boletus orovillus, pg. 526

Option 2 -
    Not as above
        AND
    Common
    -&gt; Go to Couplet 14</code></pre>
<p>Our cap is pinkish red in color, so option 2 is a better fit. Proceed to couplet 14.</p>
<h3 id="couplet-14">Couplet 14</h3>
<pre><code>Option 1 - 
    Flesh changing to blue slowly or not at all when mushroom is cut open
        AND
    Cap usually areolate in age
        AND
    Not common
    -&gt; Go to Boletus mendocinensis, pg. 519

Option 2 - 
    Flesh blueing quickly when cut
        AND
    Cap not normally areolate
    -&gt; Go to Boletus erythropus, pg. 526</code></pre>
<p>I wasn’t sure what areolate meant, so I had to look it up - effectively, it describes a mushroom that has more color towards its center than at its margins. I don’t feel like our mushroom exhibits this trait, and it certainly blued quickly, so option 2 seems to be our best bet. We have a species!</p>
